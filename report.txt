i) Problem definition:
   implement a part (module) of certain OS, which determines if the
system is in safe state or unsafe state 

 Program starts, it must read the input file (“input.txt”) that contains all the information
about processes and system resources. By reading the input file, your program decides if the
system is in safe state or unsafe state. In addition, if the system is in safe state, your program
must display the sequence of processes that satisfies safety criteria

ii)Proposed solution:

 1.Create Input file which will have required input information
 2.Read file and get all the data and allocated into arrays
 3.Determine safe or unsafe
 

 


b) Results :

 Input :
 Number of Processes: 5
Number of Resource Types: 3
Allocation
0 1 0
2 0 0
3 0 2
2 1 1
0 0 2
Max
7 5 3
3 2 2
9 0 2
2 2 2
4 3 3
Total
10 5 7
Available
3 3 2 


Output:

Allocated process : 0
Allocated process : 1
Allocated process : 2
Allocated process : 3
Safely allocated


c) No Bugs
